## Description  
By modifying a significant amount of starter code with Javascript, this application became a fledgling e-commerce website's functional back end.  It's able to CRUD query a relational database to track product details and the categories they are in and the tags that are applied to them.  Keeping track of inventory and being able to display those details on a website is possible with this money-making back end.
